Installation: 

* Use a DEDICATED chroot, i.e. the chroot should be used for
  NOTHING ELSE. Only for this build system.
* Clone this repository as /root/lo-bin-build
* remove /etc/portage/make.conf and symlink /root/lo-bin-build/config/make.conf.${ARCH} there
* symlink /root/lo-bin-build/config/keywords to /etc/portage/package.keywords/automatic
* symlink /root/lo-bin-build/config/useflags to /etc/portage/package.use/automatic

You should be able to figure out the rest for yourself.
